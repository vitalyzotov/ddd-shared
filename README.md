# ddd-shared

This library is a collection of interfaces and abstract classes to express domain-driven design concepts in Java code.
Library classes were taken from [DDD Sample Application](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core). 

### DDD Example

The [DDD Sample Application](https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core) that implements the running example in Eric Evans' [Domain-Driven Design](https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/) is also available on GitHub. It deals with cargo booking, routing and tracking.
